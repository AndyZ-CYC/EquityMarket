## Analysis and justification

For the interactive chart, we decided to re-plot the S&P 500 candlestick
chart in 2020 for a better observation of the index. We add the
mouse-over interaction to display the exact data of each "candle" of a
trading day, including the open, close, high, and low prices. With the
exact data displayed, we can observe the amount of drop downs more
directly. For example, the largest drop down happened around March 11
and 12, when the price of S&P 500 decreased from approximately 2800 to
2480 in two days (around $12.85$%). Such shock of the US market is
unprecedented in the last ten years, showing that the US market reacted
drastically to the Covid-19.
