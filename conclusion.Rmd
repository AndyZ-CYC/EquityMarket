# Conclusion

As for the impact of pandemic on the 11 sectors in the U.S., we first observed
through the ridgelines plot that they have different distributions, The stock price of
sectors such as Utilities, Real Estate follow a normal distribution, indicating their stability; price of sectors
such as Energy is bimodal, demonstrates that it might be caused by asudden shift; price of IT
shows what the distribution of highly volatile and potential industry might be. Through
such observation, we then looked at their line plots and smoothed plots to find out that
the sectors with higher price are more dependent on the market and are more prone to pandemic
than sectors with already lower stock prices. There might be a correlation. We also observed
that the impact of pandemic is not intransigent as majority of the sectors all experienced
an increase after the outbreak. As a result, we can definitely conclude that the outbreak of COVID-19
brought more or less impact across all industries, but they strive to recover from the crisis nevertheless.
