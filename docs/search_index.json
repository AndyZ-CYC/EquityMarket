Yahoo Finance contains an impressive range of data, including market indices for over 50 regions and all sector indices for the US market. The market information on Yahoo Finance updates range from real-time to at most 30 minutes. Provided by ICE data service, these data of global markets and sector markets are accurate and up-to-date. We adapted the package in R named tidyquant. With this package, we are able to acquire the market indices as a tibble object. For the stock price along, we can obtain variables including the open, high, low, close, volume, and the adjusted prices for the market index across decades of years. Recall that we separated our project into two parts: Observation of the Markets in different regions Observation of the Sectors For the first part of our project, we decide to choose one index for each region included in the Yahoo Finance database as the representation of the local market. For example, we use S&amp;P 500 to represent the US equity market, Nikkei 500 to describe the Japanese market, and the SSE Composite index for the Chinese market. As for the second part, since we wish to observe the significance of the impact on different industries, we follow the 11 stock market sectors according to the Global Industry Classification Standard. We chose to focus on the US equity market and selected to adopt the sector indices of S&amp;P 500. To make comparisons of the markets before and during the pandemic, we import data for 5 years from 2016 to 2020. We treat the data from 2016 to 2019 as the market before the pandemic, and the data in 2020 as the market during the pandemic. Information of indices of three regions: Information of S&amp;P 500 index on different sectors: The 11 sectors are: Information Technology Health Care Financials Consumer Discretionary Communication Services Industrial Consumer Staples Energy Utilities Real Estate Materials 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.2.0.1 Part 1 For the data of three different indices, we first change the tickers to the names of the corresponding indices for the purpose of easier understanding. Next, we notice that the three indices in different regions are presented in different currencies. To unify the currency, we decide to transform the units of Nikkei 225 and SSE Composite into US dollar. For the ease of calculation, we used the 5-year average exchange rates as the exchange rates between currencies. Next, since the three indices have various ranges, we normalized the indices for better comparisons. Since stock indices are time series, we adopted the time series normalization using the min and max values, and here is the equation: \\[ y = \\frac{x - x_{min}}{x_{max} - x_{min}} \\] 3.2.0.2 Part 2 For the S&amp;P 500 indices of different sectors, we change each ticker to the name of the corresponding sector. 3.2.0.3 Part 2 3.3 Missing value analysis In previous transformations, we dropped all the rows with null values. In this following part, we will take a closer look to the rows that we dropped and make proper justifications. First we take a look at the missing values in the first part: ## symbol date open high low close volume adjusted ## 0 0 21 21 21 21 21 21 ## [1] &quot;^N225&quot; From the results, we noticed that all the missing values come from the Nikkei 225 index, and there exist 21 days in total when values of Nikkei 225 index are missing. ## [1] &quot;2017-07-17&quot; &quot;2017-08-11&quot; &quot;2017-09-18&quot; &quot;2017-10-09&quot; &quot;2017-11-03&quot; ## [6] &quot;2017-11-23&quot; &quot;2018-01-01&quot; &quot;2018-01-02&quot; &quot;2018-01-03&quot; &quot;2018-01-08&quot; ## [11] &quot;2018-02-12&quot; &quot;2018-03-21&quot; &quot;2018-04-30&quot; &quot;2018-05-03&quot; &quot;2018-05-04&quot; ## [16] &quot;2018-09-17&quot; &quot;2018-09-24&quot; &quot;2018-10-08&quot; &quot;2018-11-23&quot; &quot;2018-12-24&quot; ## [21] &quot;2018-12-31&quot; By observing the dates when the value is missing, we observed no exact patterns. Hence, we dropped all the missing rows instead of performing further imputation. For the second part, similar procedures are performed: ## symbol date open high low close volume adjusted ## 0 0 152 152 152 152 152 152 ## # A tibble: 152 × 8 ## symbol date open high low close volume adjusted ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 ^SP500-45 2019-07-01 NA NA NA NA NA NA ## 2 ^SP500-45 2019-07-02 NA NA NA NA NA NA ## 3 ^SP500-45 2019-07-03 NA NA NA NA NA NA ## 4 ^SP500-35 2019-07-01 NA NA NA NA NA NA ## 5 ^SP500-35 2019-07-02 NA NA NA NA NA NA ## 6 ^SP500-35 2019-07-03 NA NA NA NA NA NA ## 7 ^SP500-40 2019-07-01 NA NA NA NA NA NA ## 8 ^SP500-40 2019-07-02 NA NA NA NA NA NA ## 9 ^SP500-40 2019-07-03 NA NA NA NA NA NA ## 10 ^SP500-25 2019-07-01 NA NA NA NA NA NA ## # … with 142 more rows After taking a closer look at the missing value, we noticed that almost all the sectors have missing value from July 1st to July 3rd in 2019. After looking into the financial events and stock market news on these days, we still failed to find out what happened on these days. As a result, we just treated these three days as holidays and dropped the rows. Meanwhile, we noticed that there exists many other missing values for the Real Estate Sectors. After taking another observation of the data in those days, we noticed that such phenomenon might be causes by the missing of any call or bid on the market during these missing days. In this situation, we are not able to impute any data, hence we choose to drop these rows as well. Besides, we also want to mention that the stock market data are gaped naturally since markets do not trade on weekends or holidays. Usually there are only 252 trading days each year. However, this will not influence our later analysis since we treat the trading days as consecutive dates. 3.4 Data For Interactive D3 Graph "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
