[["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion After observing the plots across the equity markets in three regions, we can make several conclusions. First of all, the S&amp;P 500 was the most stable index before the pandemic, while the Chinese equity market represented by the SSE Composite index is more volatile. Meanwhile, The Japanese market, represented by the Nikkei 225 index, performs similarly to the US market. During the pandemic, the US equity market reacted most drastically with greatly increased volatility and downward-leaping stock prices. The Japanese equity market performed similarly to the US market with a similar overall trend but to a less extent. On the other side, the Chinese equity market seems to receive the most negligible impact from the pandemic. The overall volatility of the stock market remained roughly the same. As for the impact of pandemic on the 11 sectors in the U.S., we first observed through the ridgelines plot that they have different distributions, The stock price of sectors such as Utilities, Real Estate follow a normal distribution, indicating their stability; price of sectors such as Energy is bimodal, demonstrates that it might be caused by a sudden shift; price of IT shows what the distribution of highly volatile and potential industry might be. Through such observation, we then looked at their line plots and smoothed plots to find out that the sectors with higher price are more dependent on the market and are more prone to pandemic than sectors with already lower stock prices. There might be a correlation. We also observed that the impact of pandemic is not intransigent as majority of the sectors all experienced an increase after the outbreak. As a result, we can definitely conclude that the outbreak of COVID-19 brought more or less impact across all industries, but they strive to recover from the crisis nevertheless. The largest obstacle when drawing the D3 interactive plot is in fact getting the data and debug locally. We’ve learned that certain browser like Chrome doesn’t allow cross origin request, in other words, we can’t read data using local path. To solve this issue we used the url of raw json file we uploaded to github, and later after importing the package ajax, we are finally able to fetch the data successfully. As for limitations, the interactive plot we created can further implement a ‘Zoom-in’ feature, which allows the user to look at each time period in details.
