We add the mouse-over interaction to display the exact data of each “candle” of a trading day, including the open, close, high, and low prices. With the exact data displayed, we can observe the amount of drop downs more directly. For example, the largest drop down happened around March 11 and 12, when the price of S&amp;P 500 decreased from approximately 2800 to 2480 in two days (around \\(12.85%\\)).
