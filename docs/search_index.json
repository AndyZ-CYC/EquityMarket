In the year since, the world has changed drastically, transforming our lives, economies, and the fortunes of our businesses—an unfolding journey reflected in the ups and downs of share prices. The global economies, industries, and societies have taken a tremendous hit due to the pandemic, not to mention the daily life of ordinary citizens. The equity market, as one of the most significant indicators of the economy, also reacted to the hits significantly and became highly volatile. This phenomenon provides insight into investigating the pandemic’s impact on the world economy in a data-driven, chronological aspect. As a great representative of the performance of the markets, the equity market indices become our focus for this research project. We will try to explore the trends and impacts of the pandemic on the markets in different regions by looking at their general stock indices. After that, we will dive deep and emphasize the effects of the pandemic on each specific industry in the U.S. 2.2 Data availability Since we wish to observe the impact of the pandemic on the equity market as a whole, we use stock market indices as the data to work with. To acquire these data, we use Yahoo Finance as a reliable source for these indices. Yahoo Finance contains an impressive range of data, including market indices for over 50 regions and all sector indices for the US market. The market information on Yahoo Finance updates range from real-time to at most 30 minutes. Provided by ICE data service, these data of global markets and sector markets are accurate and up-to-date. To acquire the data we need, we found a package in R named tidyquant. With this package, we are able to acquire the market indices as a tibble object. For the stock price along, we can obtain variables including the open, high, low, close, volume, and the adjusted prices for the market index across decades of years. As for the selection of indices, we separate our project into two parts: Observation of the Global Markets Observation of the Sectors For the first part of our project, we decide to choose one index for each region included in the Yahoo Finance database as the representation of the local market. For example, we use S&amp;P 500 to represent the US equity market, Nikkei 500 to describe the Japanese market, and the SSE Composite index for the Chinese market. As for the second part, since we wish to observe the significance of the impact on different industries, we follow the 11 stock market sectors according to the Global Industry Classification Standard. We chose to focus on the US equity market and selected to adopt the sector indices of S&amp;P 500. Lastly, for any potential needs, we may also collect information for specific stocks from Yahoo Finance as supplements for our research. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis 3.4 Data For Interactive D3 Graph", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources we use Yahoo Finance as a reliable source for these indices.

For the stock price along, we can obtain variables including the open, high, low, close, volume, and the adjusted prices for the market index across decades of years. Recall that we separated our project into two parts: Observation of the Markets in different regions Observation of the Sectors For the first part of our project, we decide to choose one index for each region included in the Yahoo Finance database as the representation of the local market. For example, we use S&amp;P 500 to represent the US equity market, Nikkei 500 to describe the Japanese market, and the SSE Composite index for the Chinese market. As for the second part, since we wish to observe the significance of the impact on different industries, we follow the 11 stock market sectors according to the Global Industry Classification Standard. We chose to focus on the US equity market and selected to adopt the sector indices of S&amp;P 500. To make comparisons of the markets before and during the pandemic, we import data for 5 years from 2016 to 2020. We treat the data from 2016 to 2019 as the market before the pandemic, and the data in 2020 as the market during the pandemic. Information of indices of three regions: Information of S&amp;P 500 index on different sectors: The 11 sectors are: Information Technology Health Care Financials Consumer Discretionary Communication Services Industrial Consumer Staples Energy Utilities Real Estate Materials 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.2.0.1 Part 1 For the data of three different indices, we first change the tickers to the names of the corresponding indices for the purpose of easier understanding. Next, we notice that the three indices in different regions are presented in different currencies. To unify the currency, we decide to transform the units of Nikkei 225 and SSE Composite into US dollar. For the ease of calculation, we used the 5-year average exchange rates as the exchange rates between currencies. Next, since the three indices have various ranges, we normalized the indices for better comparisons. Since stock indices are time series, we adopted the time series normalization using the min and max values, and here is the equation: \\[ y = \\frac{x - x_{min}}{x_{max} - x_{min}} \\] 3.2.0.2 Part 2 For the S&amp;P 500 indices of different sectors, we change each ticker to the name of the corresponding sector. 3.2.0.3 Part 2 3.3 Missing value analysis In previous transformations, we dropped all the rows with null values. In this following part, we will take a closer look to the rows that we dropped and make proper justifications. First we take a look at the missing values in the first part: ## symbol date open high low close volume adjusted ## 0 0 21 21 21 21 21 21 ## [1] &quot;^N225&quot; From the results, we noticed that all the missing values come from the Nikkei 225 index, and there exist 21 days in total when values of Nikkei 225 index are missing. ## [1] &quot;2017-07-17&quot; &quot;2017-08-11&quot; &quot;2017-09-18&quot; &quot;2017-10-09&quot; &quot;2017-11-03&quot; &quot;2017-11-23&quot; &quot;2018-01-01&quot; &quot;2018-01-02&quot; &quot;2018-01-03&quot; &quot;2018-01-08&quot; ## [11] &quot;2018-02-12&quot; &quot;2018-03-21&quot; &quot;2018-04-30&quot; &quot;2018-05-03&quot; &quot;2018-05-04&quot; &quot;2018-09-17&quot; &quot;2018-09-24&quot; &quot;2018-10-08&quot; &quot;2018-11-23&quot; &quot;2018-12-24&quot; ## [21] &quot;2018-12-31&quot; By observing the dates when the value is missing, we observed no exact patterns. Hence, we dropped all the missing rows instead of performing further imputation. For the second part, similar procedures are performed: ## symbol date open high low close volume adjusted ## 0 0 152 152 152 152 152 152 ## # A tibble: 152 × 8 ## symbol date open high low close volume adjusted ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 ^SP500-45 2019-07-01 NA NA NA NA NA NA ## 2 ^SP500-45 2019-07-02 NA NA NA NA NA NA ## 3 ^SP500-45 2019-07-03 NA NA NA NA NA NA ## 4 ^SP500-35 2019-07-01 NA NA NA NA NA NA ## 5 ^SP500-35 2019-07-02 NA NA NA NA NA NA ## 6 ^SP500-35 2019-07-03 NA NA NA NA NA NA ## 7 ^SP500-40 2019-07-01 NA NA NA NA NA NA ## 8 ^SP500-40 2019-07-02 NA NA NA NA NA NA ## 9 ^SP500-40 2019-07-03 NA NA NA NA NA NA ## 10 ^SP500-25 2019-07-01 NA NA NA NA NA NA ## # … with 142 more rows After taking a closer look at the missing value, we noticed that almost all the sectors have missing value from July 1st to July 3rd in 2019. After looking into the financial events and stock market news on these days, we still failed to find out what happened on these days. As a result, we just treated these three days as holidays and dropped the rows. Meanwhile, we noticed that there exists many other missing values for the Real Estate Sectors. After taking another observation of the data in those days, we noticed that such phenomenon might be causes by the missing of any call or bid on the market during these missing days. In this situation, we are not able to impute any data, hence we choose to drop these rows as well. Besides, we also want to mention that the stock market data are gaped naturally since markets do not trade on weekends or holidays. Usually there are only 252 trading days each year. However, this will not influence our later analysis since we treat the trading days as consecutive dates. 3.4 Data For Interactive D3 Graph For the interactive D3 Graph, we will re-plot the S&amp;P 500 candlestick chart using the data in 2020. The data is exported as a json file. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Equity market in different regions 4.2 Equity market across sectors", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Equity market in different regions 4.1.1 Boxplot One of the most significant statistics of an index is its volatility. For the very beginning, we would like to observe the volatilities of the three indices by creating a boxplot: From the boxplot, we can observe that the SSE Composite is a bit more volatile with min and max values spanning the entire range from 0 to 1. However, the IQR of these three indices are actually quite similar, indicating that there is not an enormous difference in volatility among the three markets. However, when we focus on the markets during the pandemic, we can observe that the SSE Composite becomes more volatile with a significantly larger IQR compared with the other two indices. Meanwhile, we also noticed that although the S&amp;P 500 and the Nikkei 225 seem to be less volatile, both of these two indices have significantly more amount of outliers. While the Nikkei 225 index has both large and small outliers, all of the outliers of the S&amp;P 500 are smaller than \\(Q_1 - 1.5*IQR\\). 4.1.2 Candlestick Charts To further observe the trends of the indices during the pandemic, we adopted a popular type of diagram when it comes to stock analysis, the Candlestick Charts. For the purpose of tidiness, we created a function to produce the candlestick chart for the given index and time range. For the candlestick chart of the S&amp;P 500 index in 2020, we can quickly notice the drop from approximately the end of February to the end of March, which is when the pandemic hit. The market shrank by roughly thirty percent within a month. If we observe the chart carefully, we can notice that there exist noticeable gaps between some trading days, indicating that the market was continuously impacted even after it was closed. The daily “candles” during this period were also significantly longer than the others, indicating a volatile market. However, we can notice that the market recovered gradually in the following six months and continued with a growing trend. Similar to the S&amp;P 500, the Japanese market represented by the Nikkei 225 index also took a significant impact from Covid-19 during February and March 2020. The number of green bars in this chart during the pandemic period are even less than the ones in the previous chart of S&amp;P 500 index. However, the average length of each “candle” of the Nikkei 225 is shorter than the one of the S&amp;P 500. This shows that the Japanese market shrank in a more stable path. In addition, the price of the index recovered from the impact within only approximately 4 months, which is shorter than the US market. SSE Composite index, on the other side, has a very different trend compared with the other two indices. Although there is a drop in price between February and March, the market rebounded back to previous prices during February. After April, the market gradually recovered with an upward trend until July, when a significant boost happened to the local market. This boost might be caused by the local policy of opening up after the quarantines. Overall, the trend of the SSE Composite is different, and the volatility of the Chinese market was increased due to the potential stimulation of policies. 4.1.3 Time Series Line charts By aligning the three indices together, there are several things that we can easily notice. First of all, the S&amp;P 500 index is the most stable index with a smooth upward trend line, while the SSE Composite is obviously more unstable in the last five years. In addition, the US market and the Japanese market perform very similarly in the general trends if we compare the two smooth lines. Lastly, the pandemic contributed to the largest drop in the S&amp;P 500 and the Nikkei 225 in 5 years. However, the drop in SSE Composite caused by the pandemic was relatively insignificant comparing with the overall performance of the SSE Composite in 5 years. To give the impacts of Covid-19 on markets a closer look, we focus on the data in 2020 and created another similar plot: With the zoomed data, we can observe that although the overall trends of the markets are similar, all dropped before April and turned upward, the S&amp;P index and the Nikkei 225 index share more similarity regarding the shapes and detailed trends of the prices in 2020. From this plot, we can better infer that the Chinese equity market was less influenced by the Covid-19 pandemic, while both the US market and the Japanese market were influenced by the pandemic negatively in a similar way. 4.1.4 Returns Another method of displaying volatility and comparing impacts from the pandemic across three markets is to use daily returns. In the following part, the log daily returns of the three indices are plotted separately to be observed. In this plot, we observed a clear increase in volatility during the Covid-19 pandemic. Before 2020, the log returns are represented with grey vertical bars and have a relatively low range. After the pandemic hit the market, the amplitude of log returns increased by a large amount for several month until it drop back down to the normal level. From the return plots, we can observe that, although Nikkei 225 looks similar to the S&amp;P 500 in previous plots, it is still more volatile on normal days. If we look at the return plots alone, we can say that the Japanese market is actually not impacted as severely as the US market. While the Nikkei 225 still has obvious downward clusters in daily returns, we can see that such clusters are even smaller in the return chart of the SSE Composite. The volatility of the SSE Composite’s daily returns remained at approximately the same level before and during the pandemic. Hence, from this graph, we can further infer that the Chinese market was least influenced by the pandemic among the three markets. 4.2 Equity market across sectors In the second part, we will look at all 11 sectors’ performance in S&amp;P 500 specifically to see how the pandemic may have influenced their stock prices. We will first create a ridgeline plots with visualization of 4 quartiles for the adjusted prices of the 11 sectors that ranges from year 2016 to 2020. This gives an overview for their distribution as well as modality. This plot delivers several important information. First, there are multiple sectors with a fairly normal distribution. Utilities, Real Estate, Materials, Consumer Staples and Communication services all have a mode in the middle with an almost perfect normal curve. This indicates that they are quite stable and not impacted by the market to a large extent. Second, sectors such as Financials and Energy are somewhat bi-modal. Energy sector is a more typical example. We can hypothesize/deduce that the possible reason behind such modality is there exists a time period in which the stock prices of them suddenly shifted so that the second mode hence emerges. Thirdly, sectors such as industrial, Health Care, and Consumer Discretionary are multi-modal. This indicates that they are impacted by an even larger extent. Last but not least, the Information Technology sector is undoubtedly the most special one. The curve is extremely flat and covers a very wide range of prices. We can see that the yellow part (Q4) starts at a price larger than any other sector and ends at the rightmost end of the x-axis. This indicate that Information Technology is highly volatile with a large potential. Its’ stock price may increase higher than other sectors but it might also be prone to market/external environment. 4.2.1 Timeseries line plots Now we will look at the line plots for these sectors from 2016 to 2020. Such plots visualizes the trends along time more clearly. In the above plot, there are two emphasis we want to address. First, the top three sector in adjusted price is exactly what we mentioned in the ridgeline plot with multimodality and a flat curve, which is Information Technology, Health Care, and Consumer Discretionary correspondingly. Second, we can see that all sectors prices are increasing in a somewhat steady pace from 2016 to 2018, with a sudden drop in late 2018. Then, they continue to increase with some instability and finally we observe a significant drop in price in the first quarter of 2020, which is exactly during the outbreak of pandemic. To take a closer look at year 2020, we will create another line plot that zooms into this year. In this plot, we can further confirm that the more potential sectors with high stock prices took a larger hit during the pandemic, while such impact is lessen as the stock prices goes down for other sectors. For example, the adjusted price of Information Technology was around 1800 at the start of March but later dropped to around 1250, while the Communication Services’ adjusted price was around 150-175 at the start of March, but experienced a much smaller drop in price. 4.2.2 Timeseries Smooth plots In this plot, we used geom_smooth to generate smooth lines to approximate the previous line plot. We then reordered according to ending stock price of the final day. We can clearly observe that the extent of stock price drop during March for each sector is proportional/positively correlated with their stock prices. The dynamic and changes of the curve is more dramatic in the Information technology sector, and later goes down as we iterate through each sector. It’s worth to mention that although all sectors’ prices dropped below their price at the start of the year 2020, they later climbed up gradually in different extent, and most of them end up with a higher price at the end of the year, indicating that the impact of pandemic is transient. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component 5.1 S&amp;P 500 interactive candlestick chart in 2020 5.2 Analysis and justification", " Chapter 5 Interactive component 5.1 S&amp;P 500 interactive candlestick chart in 2020 5.2 Analysis and justification For the interactive chart, we decided to re-plot the S&amp;P 500 candlestick chart in 2020 for a better observation of the index. We add the mouse-over interaction to display the exact data of each “candle” of a trading day, including the open, close, high, and low prices. With the exact data displayed, we can observe the amount of drop downs more directly. For example, the largest drop down happened around March 11 and 12, when the price of S&amp;P 500 decreased from approximately 2800 to 2480 in two days (around \\(12.85\\)%). Such shock of the US market is unprecedented in the last ten years, showing that the US market reacted drastically to the Covid-19. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion After observing the plots across the equity markets in three regions, we can make several conclusions. First of all, the S&amp;P 500 was the most stable index before the pandemic, while the Chinese equity market represented by the SSE Composite index is more volatile. Meanwhile, The Japanese market, represented by the Nikkei 225 index, performs similarly to the US market. During the pandemic, the US equity market reacted most drastically with greatly increased volatility and downward-leaping stock prices. The Japanese equity market performed similarly to the US market with a similar overall trend but to a less extent. On the other side, the Chinese equity market seems to receive the most negligible impact from the pandemic. The overall volatility of the stock market remained roughly the same. As for the impact of pandemic on the 11 sectors in the U.S., we first observed through the ridgelines plot that they have different distributions, The stock price of sectors such as Utilities, Real Estate follow a normal distribution, indicating their stability; price of sectors such as Energy is bimodal, demonstrates that it might be caused by asudden shift; price of IT shows what the distribution of highly volatile and potential industry might be. Through such observation, we then looked at their line plots and smoothed plots to find out that the sectors with higher price are more dependent on the market and are more prone to pandemic than sectors with already lower stock prices. There might be a correlation. We also observed that the impact of pandemic is not intransigent as majority of the sectors all experienced an increase after the outbreak. As a result, we can definitely conclude that the outbreak of COVID-19 brought more or less impact across all industries, but they strive to recover from the crisis nevertheless.
